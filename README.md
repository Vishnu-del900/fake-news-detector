# fake-news-detector
This project is a simple backend application built using Java and Spring Boot that detects potentially fake news using rule-based logic. The application analyzes user-provided news content, checks for suspicious keywords, and calculates a fake score percentage to classify the news as “Possibly Fake” or “Looks Real”.
